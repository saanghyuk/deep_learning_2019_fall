Form the two hypotheses to the Data

|    Data     | Hypothesis Question                                          |
| :---------: | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Credit Risk | Is the total savings(combined checking and savings account balance) of Population 2800? |
| Credit Risk | Does the total savings(combined checking and savings account balance) have a correlation with the number of months as a customer of the bank? |
|  Facebook   | Does the Hours online/week have a correlation with Friends?  |



> We used Python Libraries(Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scipy) to explore the Data,

| Correlation Coefficient(absolute value) | Interpretation        |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| up to \|0.2\|                           | very low correlation  |
| up to \|0.5\|                           | low correlation       |
| up to \|0.7\|                           | moderate correlation  |
| up to \|0.9\|                           | high correlation      |
| above \|0.9\|                           | very high correlation |



| BASIS FOR COMPARISON | T-TEST                                                       | Z-TEST                                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Meaning              | T-test refers to a type of parametric test that is applied to identify, how the means of two sets of data differ from one another when variance is not given. | Z-test implies a hypothesis test which ascertains if the means of two datasets are different from each other when variance is given. |
| Based on             | Student-t distribution                                       | Normal distribution                                          |
| Population variance  | Unknown                                                      | Known                                                        |
| Sample Size          | Small                                                        | Large                                                        |
